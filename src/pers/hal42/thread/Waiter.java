  usage:
  call waiter.prepare() BEFORE triggering behavior that will eventually notify you.
  call waiter.Start(...) to wait for notification. It returns "state" or you can get
  that same value from the state() function.

  All parameters are set by prepare(...) variations, internal defaults used for ones omitted
  Start(...) variations only modify the parameters passed, retaining ones set by the last prepare()

  see end of file for more extensive usage advice

  NOTE: JVM requires that we synch on the same object that is used for wait and notify!
